# Clergy dashboard: GitHub issues

52 issues, in working order. Each `###` entry below becomes one GitHub issue:

- **Title:** the heading text after `### `, key included (for example `DATA-1 · Request view: one row per request, with stage and time limits`).
- **Labels and milestone:** the lines under the heading.
- **Body:** everything after the `**Body**` line, up to the next `---`.

Create them in the order listed, so issue numbers run in working order. Keys like DATA-1 are for cross-references. Once the issues exist, put each issue's number on its `Number:` line, and add the number wherever a body mentions another key, for example "DATA-1 (#12)".

Definitions live in `docs/dashboard/glossary.md`. The reference query is `docs/dashboard/reference/follow-ups.sql`.

### DEC-1 · Agree the core definitions

Labels: dashboard, decision, size:S
Milestone: 1. Decide and audit
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
The same word counts different things on different pages. Connected is 117 on Members, 155 on Reports and 182 in Metabase. These definitions go into `docs/dashboard/glossary.md`, and everything else follows them.

**Decide** (recommendation in brackets)
- [ ] What counts as a member: whether leaders and admins are included, and how test accounts are excluded. (Per service for now, since only one service uses VineMe; DEV-9 covers church-wide views. Include leaders and admins, and flag test accounts on `users` rather than matching names.)
- [ ] What counts as connected. (An active member of at least one group right now. Attended but not added stays pending. Someone who left with no other group isn't connected.)
- [ ] Where people whose requests were all archived sit. (Under "Not in a group yet", with a filter for "requests closed".)
- [ ] What "new" means. ("New" means signed up in the last 30 days. "Newcomer" means new to church, from `users.newcomer`.)
- [ ] When a Needs help flag clears. (When clergy mark it handled, or the person becomes connected.)

**Done when**
- Each choice is written into `glossary.md` and its "Decision needed" marker removed.

**Blocks:** DATA-1, DATA-2, MEM-1, MEM-2

---

### DEC-2 · Agree the follow-up time rules and wording

Labels: dashboard, decision, size:S
Milestone: 1. Decide and audit
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
The Follow-ups page says 31 requests need attention, but its rules differ from the reference SQL, and the dashboard uses several words for the same idea.

**Decide** (recommendation in brackets)
- [ ] The time limits. (Keep 6 days to first contact, then 10 days after reaching out, 14 after speaking to them, and 30 from attending to being added.)
- [ ] What resets the clock. (Stage moves, status changes and notes from the group's leaders. Not admin notes, or a clergy note would make an untouched request look on track.)
- [ ] Attended but not added. (Keep its own count, but flag anyone past 30 days as needing attention. The dashboard never flags them today.)
- [ ] Stage 2's name. (Whatever leaders see in the app, "Spoken to" or "Invited", used everywhere.)
- [ ] The name for requests past their limit. ("Needs attention" everywhere. Drop "overdue", "to follow up" and "waiting" as labels.)
- [ ] Very old requests. (A nudge after 90 days with no action: "Add or archive?")

**Done when**
- Each choice is written into `glossary.md` and its marker removed.

**Blocks:** DATA-1, QW-9, FU-1, FU-2, FU-5

---

### DEC-3 · Agree how Insights measures things

Labels: dashboard, decision, size:S
Milestone: 1. Decide and audit
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
Some Metabase measures only count requests that reached a stage, so they look better than they are. Q3 2026 shows 100% attended within 30 days, but that's 4 people out of about 15 requests.

**Decide** (recommendation in brackets)
- [ ] The page's name. ("Insights" or "Stats". Not "Performance", which sounds like appraising volunteers.)
- [ ] The Results headline: people or requests. (People: 182 of 259 who asked have attended a group, about 70%. Counted by requests, it's about 50%.)
- [ ] The base for the Team measures. (Every request in the period old enough to judge, with misses counted, rather than only those that reached the stage.)
- [ ] Whether Metabase changes to match. (Yes, or the two will disagree again. Historical figures will drop.)

**Done when**
- Each choice is written into `glossary.md` and its marker removed.

**Blocks:** INS-1, INS-3, INS-4, INS-5, DATA-5

---

### DEC-4 · Agree the smaller product choices

Labels: dashboard, decision, size:S
Milestone: 1. Decide and audit
Number:

**Body**

**Decide** (recommendation in brackets)
- [ ] Invite user. (Hide it for now. Later it becomes "Invite a colleague", DEV-6.)
- [ ] What the group badge counts and sorts by. (Requests needing attention, not all pending. A group with 7 pending that are all on track isn't a problem.)
- [ ] How wide search goes. (Search on the Groups page first, and a global search later, POL-2.)
- [ ] The order of the Members cards. (All members, Not in a group yet, Pending, Connected, then Needs help and New in 30 days.)
- [ ] How the Insights groups tab is framed. ("Where to offer support", not a league table. The leaders are volunteers.)

**Done when**
- Each choice is recorded here, and in `glossary.md` where it defines a term.

**Blocks:** QW-3, GRP-1, GRP-2, MEM-1, INS-5

---

### AUD-1 · Audit every number and data point (read-only)

Labels: dashboard, data, size:M
Milestone: 1. Decide and audit
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
Several numbers disagree between pages and with Metabase, and some data on screen doesn't exist (Outreach Connect shows "Pet friendly", but there's no such field). Fixing anything before knowing why would be guesswork.

**What to do** (no code changes)
1. For every page and drawer, list each number and data point shown: the file that produces it, the tables and columns it reads, and its logic in plain English.
2. Flag anything hard-coded, guessed or not backed by a real column.
3. Compare the follow-up logic with `docs/dashboard/reference/follow-ups.sql` and list every difference.
4. Explain each of the known gaps below.
5. Answer these data questions:
   - Does `church_admin` access show the whole church or just one service?
   - Where are "I can't find a group" (needs help) requests stored?
   - How is group status (pending approval, approved, closed) stored?
   - Does `group_membership_notes` record who made each change, and whether they acted as the leader or as an admin?
   - Where are archive reasons defined?
   - Can the confirmed email and `auth.users.email_change` be read on the server?
6. Check every table, column, status value and time limit named in `docs/dashboard/glossary.md` against the code and database, and list any that are wrong.

**Reference figures** (Metabase, 22 October 2026, 6:30pm Evening Service)
- 550 people: 182 attended a group, 77 requested but haven't attended, 291 never requested
- 259 people have made a request (the User-Requests bar shows 257)
- 314 requests: 50% in a group, 15% pending, 28% archived, 7% left
- Archived requests by reason: No longer interested 51, Not contactable 25, Not suitable for group 7, Group at capacity 5

**Known gaps to explain**
- Total people: Overview 558, Metabase 550, Members 500
- Connected or attended: Members 117, Reports 155, Metabase 182
- Requested: Reports 24 (people still waiting) against Metabase 77 (which includes people whose requests were all archived)
- Pending: Members 30 (people) against Overview 46 (requests)
- Need attention 31 plus on track 8 is 39, exactly everyone before Attended, so the 30-day Attended rule isn't applied
- Follow-up cards count days past the limit, not days waiting (one card says "Overdue 157 days" where its drawer says "requested 163 days ago")
- May sign-ups: 13 on the dashboard, 10 in Metabase; the other months match
- The follow-up drawer says "Invited" where everything else says "Spoken to"
- The Follow-ups intro mentions a "Review" button that doesn't exist and says changes aren't saved, while the drawer says ticking a box saves straight away

**Done when**
- `docs/dashboard/audit.md` is committed, covering all six steps.

**Plan mode:** yes

---

### QW-1 · Members list stops at 500 and search misses people

Labels: dashboard, bug, members, size:M
Milestone: 2. Quick wins and bugs
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
Members shows "500 of 500 people", but there are about 550, and searching for someone known to be there finds nothing. It looks like a row limit, with search only filtering the rows already loaded.

**What to do**
- Find where the list is limited.
- Paginate and search on the server, so every member can be reached and the count is the true total.

**Done when**
- The count shows the true total. Until DEC-1 settles the definition, that's the database count of members.
- Searching finds people beyond the first 500.

**Plan mode:** yes

---

### QW-2 · Settings: "Coming soon" over the ChurchSuite section

Labels: dashboard, settings, size:S
Milestone: 2. Quick wins and bugs
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
The ChurchSuite connection isn't finished (DEV-5).

**What to do**
- Cover the ChurchSuite section with a grey panel saying "Coming soon". Nothing underneath can be clicked.

**Done when**
- The section is clearly unavailable and can't be used.

---

### QW-3 · Overview: slimmer header, hide "Invite user"

Labels: dashboard, overview, size:S
Milestone: 2. Quick wins and bugs
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
The dark banner takes a lot of space, and "Invite user" doesn't work.

**What to do**
- Reduce the banner to the church and service name, with one short line at most.
- Remove "Connect ChurchSuite from Settings", since Settings now says Coming soon.
- Hide "Invite user". DEV-6 brings it back properly.

**Done when**
- The stat cards sit near the top of a laptop screen.

**Depends on:** DEC-4

---

### QW-4 · Groups: tidy the cards and drawer

Labels: dashboard, groups, size:S
Milestone: 2. Quick wins and bugs
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- List every leader on each card, not just the first: "Led by Sam and Alex", with "+1" beyond two.
- Remove the pet tags. There's no pet field in the database. Note in the commit where "Pet friendly" on Outreach Connect was coming from (AUD-1 should already say).
- Show a short area on cards (like "Chelsea") rather than a full address. Beta Connect Group shows a full street and postcode. If there's no area field, say so rather than inventing one.
- In the group drawer, remove the location and time from the header, since "When and where" repeats them just below.

**Done when**
- No card shows invented data, every leader is named, and nothing repeats in the drawer.

**Depends on:** AUD-1

---

### QW-5 · Drawers: tidy copy and remove dead buttons

Labels: dashboard, shared, size:S
Milestone: 2. Quick wins and bugs
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Follow-up drawer: change the note placeholder from "Seen by leaders of this group" to "Send a note to this group's leaders".
- Member drawer: remove "Review their follow-up" (it goes nowhere) and "Browse groups".

**Done when**
- No button in a drawer leads nowhere.

---

### QW-6 · Shared contact block with formatted phone numbers

Labels: dashboard, shared, size:S
Milestone: 2. Quick wins and bugs
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
The follow-up and member drawers each show a raw number like 447700900123. They should share one component.

**What to do**
- Make one contact block, used by both drawers.
- Format UK numbers as +44 7700 900123. Keep the Call and WhatsApp buttons.
- Leave room for an email (DATA-4) and for a second row for the group's leader (FU-3).

**Done when**
- Both drawers use the same component and show formatted numbers.

---

### QW-7 · Follow-ups: collapse group leader view by default

Labels: dashboard, follow-ups, size:S
Milestone: 2. Quick wins and bugs
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- In the "Group leader" view, start with every group collapsed.
- The "Status" view stays expanded, as now.

**Done when**
- Switching to Group leader shows a compact list of groups.

---

### QW-8 · Overview chart: readable stage colours

Labels: dashboard, overview, size:S
Milestone: 2. Quick wins and bugs
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
The four stages in "Pending requests by group" are close shades of pink and hard to tell apart.

**What to do**
- Use the stage colours from the chart palette (DEV-10): clearly distinct, none of them red or green (those are reserved for needs attention and on track).
- Use the same stage colours anywhere stages appear, taken from the palette tokens rather than hard-coded.

**Done when**
- The stages can be told apart at a glance, in light and dark mode.

**Depends on:** DEV-10

---

### QW-9 · One name for each stage everywhere

Labels: dashboard, shared, size:S
Milestone: 2. Quick wins and bugs
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
The follow-up drawer says "Invited" where the rest of the dashboard, and the reference SQL, say "Spoken to".

**What to do**
- Use the stage names agreed in DEC-2 in every page, drawer, chart, legend and filter.

**Done when**
- Searching the code finds one name per stage.

**Depends on:** DEC-2

---

### DATA-1 · Request view: one row per request, with stage and time limits

Labels: dashboard, data, size:L
Milestone: 3. Data foundations
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
Each page calculates its own numbers, so they disagree. One view, read by both the dashboard and Metabase, fixes that at the source.

**What to do**
- Create a Postgres view with one row per request: person, group, the group's leaders, status, stage, request date, the dates first reached out, spoken to and attended, added date, archive reason, last action date, days since the last action, current limit, needs attention or on track, and days until due.
- Base it on `docs/dashboard/reference/follow-ups.sql`, keeping its one-hour undo guard, with these fixes:
  - a left join to leaders (the inner join drops requests to groups with no active leader)
  - exclude leaders' own memberships of their groups
  - apply the clock rules agreed in DEC-2, including the 30-day Attended rule
  - exclude test accounts the way DEC-1 agrees
- Respect row-level security (`security_invoker = true`), so one church can never see another's data.

**Done when**
- Its counts reconcile with the reference figures in AUD-1, or each difference is explained in `audit.md`.

**Depends on:** DEC-1, DEC-2, AUD-1

**Plan mode:** yes

---

### DATA-2 · Person view: one row per member

Labels: dashboard, data, size:M
Milestone: 3. Data foundations
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Build on DATA-1. One row per member: signed-up date, newcomer, role, connected, furthest stage, number of pending requests, whether any request needs attention, needs help (open), and whether all their requests were archived.
- Use the same row-level security approach as DATA-1.

**Done when**
- Connected + Pending + Not in a group yet = All members.
- The totals match the definitions in `glossary.md`.

**Depends on:** DATA-1, DEC-1

**Plan mode:** yes

---

### DATA-3 · Point the existing numbers at the views

Labels: dashboard, data, size:M
Milestone: 3. Data foundations
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Overview cards, Follow-ups counts and cards, Members cards and list, and Groups badges all read from the views.
- No redesign yet. Only the source of each number changes.

**Done when**
- The same number shows the same value on every page.

**Depends on:** DATA-1, DATA-2

**Plan mode:** yes

---

### DATA-4 · Email in the contact block, read on the server

Labels: dashboard, data, shared, size:M
Milestone: 3. Data foundations
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Show the confirmed email, falling back to `auth.users.email_change` when there isn't one.
- Read it on the server only. The browser must never query the auth schema.
- Add an Email button (mailto) to the contact block.

**Done when**
- Drawers show an email where one exists, and the auth schema isn't exposed to the browser.

**Depends on:** AUD-1, QW-6

**Plan mode:** yes

---

### DATA-5 · Bring Metabase in line (Olly, in Metabase)

Labels: dashboard, data, size:M
Milestone: 3. Data foundations
Number:

**Body**

**What to do** (in Metabase, not Claude Code)
- Change the inner join on leaders to a left join.
- Exclude leaders' own memberships.
- Add a "Not contacted" segment to the User-Requests bar.
- Fix the "Total Requests by Group" legend: its light grey is labelled "joined", but the same grey means "left" in the Total Requests donut.
- Show year-on-year in points: "58% (73% last year)".
- Apply the test-account exclusion agreed in DEC-1.
- Once DATA-1 and DATA-2 exist, point the questions at the views.

**Done when**
- Metabase and the dashboard show the same numbers.

**Depends on:** DEC-1, DEC-3, DATA-1, DATA-2

---

### FU-1 · Follow-ups: explanation and totals at the top

Labels: dashboard, follow-ups, size:S
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Replace the intro text. It mentions a "Review" button that doesn't exist and says changes aren't saved.
- Add a short explanation: what a pending request is (asked to join, not yet added or archived, so Attended still counts), what on track and needs attention mean, and the time limits. One line, plus a "How this works" expander.
- Show the total so it ties back to Overview, for example "46 pending requests: 31 need attention, 8 on track, 7 attended but not yet added".

**Done when**
- A new clergy member can understand the page without asking, and the total matches Overview.

**Depends on:** DEC-2, DATA-3

---

### FU-2 · Follow-ups: plain-language cards and colours

Labels: dashboard, follow-ups, size:M
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Replace "Overdue X days" and "Due in X days" with plain wording:
  - Not contacted: "Waiting 122 days, no contact yet"
  - Other stages: "Spoken to 40 days ago", or "Spoken to 3 days ago, follow up within 11 days"
- Count days since the request (for Not contacted) or since the last action, not days past the limit.
- Red when it needs attention, green when on track. The wording must still work without the colour.
- Make the stage headings inside each group stand out more.

**Done when**
- Every card reads as a plain sentence, and its colour matches its status.

**Depends on:** DEC-2, DATA-3

---

### FU-3 · Follow-ups drawer: full history, leader contact, real archive reasons

Labels: dashboard, follow-ups, size:M
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- History: show every note and every stage change, with dates, visually distinct from each other, and who made each one where that's recorded.
- Add a second row to the contact block: "Leader: [name]", with call, WhatsApp and email.
- Archive reasons: read them from where the app defines them (AUD-1 says where), replacing the current list.

**Done when**
- The drawer shows the whole story of a request, and both people's contact details.

**Depends on:** QW-6, AUD-1

---

### FU-4 · Follow-ups: confirm before acting on a leader's behalf

Labels: dashboard, follow-ups, size:M
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- When an admin ticks a stage or archives a request, show a confirmation: "You're updating this on behalf of [leader name]", with an optional note.
- Record in the history that an admin made the change.
- Notifying the leader is DEV-2, not this issue.

**Done when**
- No admin change happens without the confirmation, and the history shows who made it.

**Depends on:** DEC-2, and DEV-7 if AUD-1 finds changes don't record who made them

**Plan mode:** yes

---

### FU-5 · Follow-ups: nudge on very old requests

Labels: dashboard, follow-ups, size:S
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
Many requests from 2025 are probably resolved but never updated, such as King's Road's batch from last autumn. They crowd out the requests that are really slipping.

**What to do**
- Requests with no action for the threshold agreed in DEC-2 (recommended: 90 days) show "Add or archive?", with both actions to hand.

**Done when**
- Very old requests are clearly marked and can be resolved in one or two clicks.

**Depends on:** DEC-2

---

### MEM-1 · Members: top cards

Labels: dashboard, members, size:M
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Order: All members, Not in a group yet, Pending, Connected, then Needs help and New in 30 days.
- Rename "Looking for a group" to "Not in a group yet". "Needs help" is only for people who've asked.
- The three middle cards add up to All members. Set Needs help and New in 30 days apart, since they overlap with the others.
- Give Pending both units: "30 people · 46 requests".
- Each card filters the list, and the filter goes in the URL (for example `?filter=needs-help`) so Overview can link to it.

**Done when**
- The middle three cards add up to the total, and every card can be linked to.

**Depends on:** DEC-1, DEC-4, DATA-2

---

### MEM-2 · Members: table columns and status

Labels: dashboard, members, size:M
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Put "Signed up" first, with the full date.
- Role: Admin, Leader, Newcomer or Existing member, with role filters to match.
- Groups: the count, then the names, cut off if long: "2 · Outreach Connect, Central…"
- Status, in small pieces with one job each: the furthest stage; "+3 others pending" if they have more open requests; a Needs help tag; a red marker if any request needs attention.
- Add a sort: "Most open requests".
- Use one meaning of "New" (DEC-1).

**Done when**
- At a glance, you can tell where someone has got to, what's still open and whether anything is slipping.

**Depends on:** DEC-1, DATA-2

---

### MEM-3 · Members: person drawer

Labels: dashboard, members, size:M
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Each group row shows the stage and timing in the same wording and colours as the follow-up cards (FU-2). Clicking a row opens that request's follow-up drawer, reusing the component.
- Add a collapsed "Past requests" section for archived requests, with their reasons.
- Use the shared contact block.

**Done when**
- From a person, any of their requests is one click away.

**Depends on:** FU-2, QW-5, QW-6

---

### GRP-1 · Groups: count, filters and search

Labels: dashboard, groups, size:M
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Show a count at the top ("18 groups") that updates with filters.
- Add filters: Taking new members and At capacity. They apply to the map as well as the cards, and go in the URL so Overview's card can link to `?filter=at-capacity`.
- Add a search box covering group name, leader and member.

**Done when**
- Filtering to At capacity shows the right count on both the cards and the map, and searching a leader's name finds their group.

**Depends on:** DEC-4

---

### GRP-2 · Groups: badge and sort

Labels: dashboard, groups, size:S
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- The badge shows the count agreed in DEC-4 (recommended: requests needing attention), in glossary wording, replacing "X to follow up".
- Sort by it, and change "busiest first" to match, for example "Most people waiting first".

**Done when**
- The badge and sort use the same number as Follow-ups.

**Depends on:** DEC-4, DATA-3

---

### GRP-3 · Groups: Active / Closed switch

Labels: dashboard, groups, size:S
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Add a switch between active and closed groups. Pending approval joins it later (DEV-3).

**Done when**
- Closed groups can be found without cluttering the main view.

**Depends on:** AUD-1 (how group status is stored)

---

### GRP-4 · Groups drawer: open a member's drawer

Labels: dashboard, groups, size:S
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Clicking a member in the group drawer opens their member drawer (MEM-3). Reuse it rather than building a second one.

**Done when**
- A group member's details are one click away.

**Depends on:** MEM-3

---

### OV-1 · Overview: four clickable cards

Labels: dashboard, overview, size:S
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Four cards, by urgency: Needs help; Pending requests (with "31 need attention" beneath); Groups at capacity ("5 of 18"); Total members.
- Each card is clearly clickable (hover state, pointer) and opens the filtered page: Members filtered to needs help, Follow-ups, Groups filtered to at capacity, and Members.

**Done when**
- Every card opens the page that explains its number.

**Depends on:** MEM-1, GRP-1, DATA-3

---

### OV-2 · Overview: pending chart toggle

Labels: dashboard, overview, size:M
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Add a toggle to "Pending requests by group": by stage, or by needs attention and on track.
- In the needs-attention view, sort groups by how many need attention.
- Keep "View as table".

**Done when**
- Clergy can see which groups have requests slipping, not just how many are pending.

**Depends on:** QW-8, DATA-3

---

### OV-3 · Overview: "This week" strip

Labels: dashboard, overview, size:S
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- A slim strip showing new requests this week, requests resolved this week (added or archived), and new sign-ups this week.

**Done when**
- It's clear at a glance whether the backlog is growing or shrinking.

**Depends on:** DATA-1, DATA-2

---

### OV-4 · Overview: who's waiting longest

Labels: dashboard, overview, size:M
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Replace the newest-people list with the people who have the most open requests, showing how many are open and how many have been actioned. One person currently has 6 requests, 5 of them still pending.
- Each opens their member drawer.
- Keep a line with "X new this week", linking to Members sorted newest first.

**Done when**
- The people most at risk of falling through are on the front page.

**Depends on:** DATA-2, MEM-3

---

### INS-1 · Insights: rename, four tabs and page-wide filters

Labels: dashboard, insights, size:M
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Rename the page as agreed in DEC-3.
- Reduce six tabs to four: Activity (was Downloads), Results (was Pipeline and Connection), Groups and Team. Newcomers becomes a filter.
- Page-wide filters: Everyone or Newcomers (check it actually filters), a date range, and week, month or quarter. Put them in the URL.
- Headings as plain questions. No "pipeline", "effectiveness" or "performance".

**Done when**
- Four tabs, filters that apply everywhere, and no corporate words.

**Depends on:** DEC-3

### INS-2 · Insights: Activity tab

Labels: dashboard, insights, size:M
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Two charts: people by the date they signed up, and requests by the date they were made. They answer different questions, so keep them apart.
- Both follow the week, month or quarter toggle, with the current period marked in progress.
- Check May: 13 sign-ups here against 10 in Metabase.

**Done when**
- Both charts match Metabase for the same period.

**Depends on:** INS-1, DATA-2

---

### INS-3 · Insights: Results tab

Labels: dashboard, insights, size:L
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Two headline numbers, each with a one-line explanation: "Got to a group" and "Stuck", as defined in the glossary.
- A chart of requests per month, with the share that ended up connected. Mark recent months as in progress.
- Why requests were closed: the archive reasons, plus how long people had waited before "No longer interested" (days waiting is in the reference SQL). If long waits dominate, that's the leakage story in one chart.
- Note beside the reasons that "Not suitable for group" and "Group at capacity" are re-referral cases (DEV-4).

**Done when**
- A clergy member can say how well VineMe is working in one sentence, with the number.

**Depends on:** INS-1, DATA-1, DATA-2, DEC-3

---

### INS-4 · Insights: Team tab

Labels: dashboard, insights, size:M
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Three measures over time, counted from the request date: reached out within 6 days, spoken to within 16, attended within 30.
- The base is every request in the period old enough to judge, with misses counted.
- Mark the current period as in progress.
- Show year-on-year in points: "58% (73% last year)".

**Done when**
- The numbers can't flatter themselves: a quarter with 4 attended out of 15 requests can't show 100%.

**Depends on:** INS-1, DATA-1, DEC-3

---

### INS-5 · Insights: Groups scorecard

Labels: dashboard, insights, size:L
Milestone: 4. Pages
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- One table, one row per group: requests, members, needs attention now, and the three Team measures.
- Sortable by any column, with a small rank number in each cell and shading like the Metabase tables.
- Show the count next to every percentage, and grey out groups with fewer than 5 requests in the period.
- Frame it as "Where to offer support", with a filter for pending.
- Add a "See stats" button to the group drawer that opens this tab, filtered to that group.

**Done when**
- Clergy can spot which groups need support, without small numbers misleading them.

**Depends on:** INS-1, INS-4, DEC-4

### POL-1 · Tap a profile picture to enlarge it

Labels: dashboard, shared, size:M
Milestone: 5. Polish
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- One shared avatar component. Tapping the photo zooms it out from where it sits (a shared element transition) into a larger, centred view (a lightbox).
- Use it in every drawer. Escape or a click outside closes it.

**Done when**
- It works in the follow-up, member and group drawers, from the same component.

---

### POL-2 · Search across the dashboard

Labels: dashboard, shared, size:M
Milestone: 5. Polish
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- A search bar in the top navigation that finds people and groups from any page, reusing the server-side search from QW-1 and GRP-1.

**Done when**
- Typing a name finds the person and their groups from anywhere.

**Depends on:** QW-1, GRP-1

---

### DEV-1 · Notify the leader when an admin adds a note

Labels: dashboard, needs-dev, follow-ups
Milestone: 6. Dev backlog
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
Clergy can add notes in the dashboard, but leaders won't see them unless they're told.

**What to do**
- When an admin adds a note to a request, notify the group's leaders in the app: "[Name] added a note about [person]".

**Done when**
- Leaders get a notification that opens the request.

---

### DEV-2 · Notify the leader when an admin acts on their behalf

Labels: dashboard, needs-dev, follow-ups
Milestone: 6. Dev backlog
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
FU-4 lets clergy update a stage or archive a request for a leader. The leader needs to know their list changed.

**What to do**
- Notify the group's leaders: "[Name] updated [person] to Spoken to on your behalf", including any note.

**Done when**
- Every admin change to a leader's request produces a notification.

**Depends on:** FU-4

---

### DEV-3 · Group approval flow

Labels: dashboard, needs-dev, groups
Milestone: 6. Dev backlog
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- When someone asks to create a group, notify clergy.
- Let clergy approve or decline it from the dashboard.
- Flag new group requests on Overview.
- Show pending groups in the Groups page switch (GRP-3).

**Done when**
- A new group can go from request to approved without leaving the dashboard.

---

### DEV-4 · Refer someone to a group

Labels: dashboard, needs-dev, members
Milestone: 6. Dev backlog
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
When a group isn't the right fit, the person should be pointed to another one, not dropped. So far 12 requests have been closed as "Not suitable for group" (7) or "Group at capacity" (5). The same action lets clergy place someone who asked for help.

**What to do**
- In the app and the dashboard, refer a person to a different group. This creates a new request to that group's leaders, notifies the person, and the cycle starts again.
- Offer it straight after archiving with "Not suitable for group" or "Group at capacity".
- In the dashboard: a "Refer to a group" button in the member drawer footer, and in the needs help flow.

**Done when**
- A person can be re-referred in a few clicks, and the new request shows up like any other.

### DEV-5 · ChurchSuite sync in Settings

Labels: dashboard, needs-dev, settings
Milestone: 6. Dev backlog
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
Churches want VineMe groups on their own websites. The plan is to sync VineMe and ChurchSuite groups rather than rebuild VineMe as a website.

**What to do**
- Sync groups between VineMe and ChurchSuite, including capacity and memberships, with join requests made on the church website flowing back into VineMe.
- Replace the "Coming soon" panel (QW-2) with the real connection settings.

**Done when**
- A church can connect ChurchSuite from Settings and see its groups on its website.

---

### DEV-6 · Invite a colleague to the dashboard

Labels: dashboard, needs-dev, shared
Milestone: 6. Dev backlog
Number:

**Body**

**What to do**
- Let an admin invite another clergy or staff member to the dashboard, with a chosen role.
- Use the roles from DEV-9, so a colleague only sees what their role allows.
- Bring back the "Invite user" button (hidden in QW-3) once it works.

**Done when**
- An invited colleague can sign in and sees only what their role allows.

**Depends on:** DEV-9

---

### DEV-7 · Record who made each change

Labels: dashboard, needs-dev, data
Milestone: 6. Dev backlog
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
Only needed if AUD-1 finds that `group_membership_notes` doesn't record who made a change. Without it, the history can't tell a leader's action from an admin's, and the clock rule in DEC-2 can't separate leader notes from admin notes.

**What to do**
- Record the author of every note and every stage or status change, and whether they acted as the group's leader or as an admin.

**Done when**
- Every row in `group_membership_notes` has an author and their role.

**Depends on:** AUD-1

---

### DEV-8 · Group details as real fields, like pet friendly

Labels: dashboard, needs-dev, groups
Milestone: 6. Dev backlog
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
The dashboard showed pet tags with no data behind them. They're a nice idea, but they need to be real. Low priority.

**What to do**
- Let leaders set group details in the app, such as pet friendly.
- Then show them on the Groups page.

**Done when**
- Every tag on a group card comes from a field a leader set.

---

### DEV-9 · Rethink role-level access: service and church views

Labels: dashboard, needs-dev, shared
Milestone: 6. Dev backlog
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
Today the `church_admin` role opens the dashboard, and it isn't clear whether it shows the whole church or one service (AUD-1 finds out). Only one service uses VineMe now, but that will change. Aonghas is keen to help think this through and should be involved.

**What to do**
- Design the roles with Aonghas: a service pastor sees their own service; a church pastor sees the whole church and can drill down into each service.
- Make the request and person views (DATA-1, DATA-2) respect those roles through row-level security.
- Add a service picker for anyone who can see more than one service.

**Done when**
- Each role sees exactly its own scope, and church-wide request counts add up to the sum of each service's.

**Depends on:** AUD-1, DATA-1, DATA-2

### DEV-10 · Chart colour palette, built from the brand colours

Labels: dashboard, needs-dev, design, shared
Milestone: 6. Dev backlog
Number:

**Body**

**Why**
The charts use four close shades of pink, so the stages can't be told apart at a glance. The brand colour scheme already set up in the repo is a good base, but charts need more than shades of one colour. QW-8 and the Insights charts wait on this, so it's worth doing early.

**What to do**
- Start from the colour scheme already in the repo, and extend it rather than adding a second set.
- Define:
  - four stage colours (Not contacted, Reached out, Spoken to, Attended) that read as an order and are clearly distinct, none of them red or green
  - status colours for needs attention (red) and on track (green), used for nothing else
  - a small set of colours for other charts, such as sign-ups against requests
- Check contrast and colour blindness, in light and dark mode.
- Store them as tokens in the codebase, and note them in the Colours section of `docs/dashboard/glossary.md`.

**Done when**
- The palette exists as tokens, is documented in the glossary, and passes the contrast and colour-blindness checks.
