-- Followed up in time: the three Team measures, using the counting rule agreed in DEC-3 (docs/dashboard/glossary.md).
-- One row per request. Each measure is 'Hit', 'Miss', or null when the result isn't known yet.
-- A result is known once the request reaches the stage, is archived before reaching it, or passes the limit.
-- Limits are counted from the request date: reached out within 6 days, spoken to within 16, attended within 30.
-- Stage dates use the one-hour undo guard from follow-ups.sql. A skipped stage takes the date of the later stage.
