        the Service during the Pilot Period for the purpose of connecting
        congregation members with small groups.
      </LegalP>
      <LegalP>
        The Service is delivered entirely through the VineMe app. There is no
        separate web-based administration dashboard at this stage. Church

        the app itself.
      </LegalP>
      <LegalH3>2.2 Availability</LegalH3>
      <LegalP>
        VineMe will use reasonable endeavours to keep the Service available and
        operational throughout the Pilot Period. However, we cannot guarantee
        uninterrupted availability. Planned maintenance or unexpected technical
        issues may occasionally result in temporary unavailability. We will aim to
        provide reasonable notice of planned maintenance where possible.
      </LegalP>
      <LegalP>
        VineMe does not guarantee that the Service will meet every specific
        requirement of the Church, be entirely free from defects, or achieve any
        particular outcome.
      </LegalP>
      <LegalH3>2.3 Support</LegalH3>
      <LegalP>
        During the Pilot Period, VineMe will provide reasonable support to the
        Church&apos;s primary contact via email at{" "}

          connect@vineme.app
        </a>
        . We aim to respond to support enquiries within 2 working days.
      </LegalP>
      <LegalP>
        Support is available for issues relating to the operation of the Service.
        VineMe is not responsible for providing support in relation to the
        Church&apos;s own devices, internet connectivity, or internal systems.
      </LegalP>
      <LegalH3>2.4 Updates and Changes to the Service</LegalH3>
      <LegalP>
        VineMe may update or modify the Service from time to time, including to
        introduce new features or to make improvements. We will aim to notify the
        Church&apos;s primary contact of any significant changes in advance.
      </LegalP>

      <LegalH2>3. Pilot Period and Fees</LegalH2>
      <LegalH3>3.1 Pilot Duration</LegalH3>
      <LegalP>
        The Pilot Period shall commence on the date this Agreement is signed and
        shall continue for an initial period of [INSERT DURATION, e.g. 6 months],
        unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 9 of this Agreement.
      </LegalP>
      <LegalH3>3.2 Pilot Fee</LegalH3>
      <LegalP>
        In consideration for access to the Service during the Pilot Period, the
        Church agrees to pay VineMe a pilot fee of £20 (twenty pounds), payable
        within 30 days of the date of this Agreement. Payment should be made by
        bank transfer to the details provided separately by VineMe.
      </LegalP>
      <LegalP>
        This fee is non-refundable except in the event of early termination by
        VineMe without cause.
      </LegalP>
      <LegalH3>3.3 End of Pilot Period</LegalH3>
      <LegalP>
        At least 30 days before the end of the Pilot Period, VineMe and the Church
        agree to discuss in good faith whether to continue the arrangement and on
        what terms. Neither party is under any obligation to continue beyond the
        Pilot Period.
      </LegalP>
      <LegalP>
        If no new agreement is reached before the end of the Pilot Period, access
        to the Service will cease at the end of the Pilot Period and the
        Church&apos;s data will be handled in accordance with Section 7.5 of this
        Agreement.
